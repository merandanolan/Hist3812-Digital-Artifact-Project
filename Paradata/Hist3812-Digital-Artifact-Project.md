Object: Dessert /tea plate by Sovereign Potters Canada

Software used: Trnio 

Reasoning for software: Trnio was user friendly and easy to use. It produced results the fastest, which allowed for more efficient testing and experimentation. 

Reasoning for choosing object: Object was created by a company that has deep historical roots in Canada. Sovereign Potters products were extremely popular because of their quality and affordability. The object also has personal significance, since they were first acquired by Great Grandmother and have been passed down through the family since then.

Audience: I hope to include this object in a family historical archive that I have been working on. Therefore, the main audience would be my immediate and extended family. The Family Archive project is meant to consolidate information, photographs, stories, and artefacts from individual homes to one main online resource. I plan on following a similar plan as the ACCORD project by involving and relying on family or “community members” to aid in the collection of the material (Maxwell, M, 2017). However, this object could also be useful to vintage dinnerware collectors or enthusiasts. The specific design of my plate appears on a few online vintage / antiques stores (Etsy, 2018) (eBay, 2018). 

Accessibility: In terms of the accessibility of the 3D model itself, if the audience has a functioning computer and internet connection they should be able to access it without issue. However, in terms of the audience of the larger resource the model is a part of, there have been issues with the elderly and rural participants not having access to the technology necessary to contribute digital copies to the archive. So far, the solution to this has been for younger family members who live close by to complete the task on their behalf. The project has the possibility of not being sustainable if the chain of information collection breaks down.

Research process: There is limited research possibilities for the object itself. Its provenance can only be tracked so far, as there is no physical evidence of its movement and the known original owner has since passed away.  Fortunately, there is slightly more information available on the potter company and its origins (Archives, 2015). 

Issues and what I would like to change:  I ran into difficulty while trying to edit the model. The error messages were unhelpful in determining what the issue was and what needed to be adjusted. This being said, in the future I would like to be able to improve the quality of my model by removing the background and adjusting the image clarity.

MODULE 2:

Object: Mosaic Photograph

Remixed Objects: 
  - Used the Texture.JPEG image (provided from the Zephyr 3D Model used in testing Module 1) 
  - Family Photograph (Ann, Grandmother, Mother, Wayne, Eileen, Cyril, at Christmas 1981 )
  
 Software: Mosaically.com and Windows Photo viewer (edit& create feature) 
  
 Reasoning for Software: 
  Mosaically.com is free to use and has user friendly interface. I already has Windows Photo viewer and have used it in the past. Their   photo editing feature is easy to use and is compatible with Mosaically.com. 
 
 Reasoning for Remixing objects:
    - Used Photobashing technique as described by Tara Copplestones' blog post "Making Things: Photobashing As Archaeological                 Remediation?" (2015). I was inspired by her perspective on making the documentation process more creative and personal. By turning       two archived family heirlooms into a creative "art" piece, I feel it makes them more approachable and interactive. 
    - [see personal reasoning for choosing original object in Mod 1] Family Photograph contains depicts the 3 people who owned the plate       before myself. 
    
  Audience: [see Audience for mod 1] I would also like to include remixed photographs in the database. 
  
  Accessibility: [see Accessibility for mod1] Basic internet access, possibility a Facebook account? (at least until the database is                      officially available. 
  
  Issues and what I would like to change: 
          Overall, this process was smooth and fun to do. It did take some experimentation with finding                                           the correct colours to match the main photograph and make the mosaic as clear as possible.

  MODULE 4:
  Paradata:
  
  Object (s): ARIS game, Saint Joseph's welcome sign photograph, Plate photograph
  
  Reasoning for Objects: The photograph of the plate for the actual digital artifact. the photograph of the welcome sign as a way to       introduce the theme of the tour / game. 
  
  Software: ARIS & Vuforia
  
  Reasoning for software: my main draw to ARIS was that I could intergrate my objects with a physical location that was away from where   i physically was. I wanted to be able to create a "virtual" tour of the town.
  
  Theme / idea behind game: The main goal of the game was to create a virtual tour of the town. While there may or may not be other       artifacts added in the future, the focus for now is the plate (and by extension the welcome sign for context). In theory, someone would be able to walk around the town and be introduced to different artifacts, stories, photographs, history, etc. 
  
  Audience: [see mod 1] The audience may also include people with little knowledge of the area and are interested in its history. 
  
  Accessibility: Must have IOS smartphone 
  
  Issues/ challenges / what I would change: Software was easy enough to use. It did take some experimentation in how to use the objects in relation to the triggers. This resulted in creating multiple versions of the game, as it was difficult to edit the order of triggers and objects once they were created. The tutorials were unhelpful in showing me how to publish the game, none seemed to work properly. an issue I ran into was the inability to properly test the finished result, both because of the publishing issues, but also because I am not physically in the location the game takes place. In the future, I would like to add more objects to make the virtual tour more comprehensive. as well as creating a test game set to my current location for the purpose of properly testing the game.
