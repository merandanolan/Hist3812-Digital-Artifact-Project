Photo editing: Mosaically.com & Windows Photo Editor

Edits made to original image – Main Family Photo (windows photo editor): Brightened image and cropped out darker corners. Brightened photo to better match the shades of colours that were being pulled from the Texture image. Some of the first tests did not look right because the overlaying mosaic tiles were too light and did not match the darker colours in the family photo. 

Edits made to Texture Image: Used the Crop and edit feature on Windows Photo editor to isolate specific colours /shade, then used various filters (mainly Original, Rouge, slate, Denim, Mercury). Created aprox 40 separate images from the Texture image to input into Mosaically.com. 

Edits made through Mosaically.com: 
•	Through testing determined that a 60% colour match or higher between the main photo and texture photos made for the best results.
•	Final Mosaic image had about an 80% colour match. 
•	Big Picture size: 4x6
•	Small Picture size: 0.50 x 0.50
•	Even Spread Factor: 7
•	No filter
•	Colorization: 40%
