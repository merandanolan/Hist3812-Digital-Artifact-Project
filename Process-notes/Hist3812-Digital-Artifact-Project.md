3D Model project - process notes:
Jan 15, 2018
Brainstorm:
•	Windsor Arms Historical residential building (lobby? Front entrance? Mail room?)
    o	Personal connection to building
    o	historical significance in Ottawa
    o	Many original features still in tact
    o	Might be difficult to build a 3D model of due to size 
•	House plants
    o	Build a repository / guide to house plants using 3D models of the plants
    o	Con: no significant history, not an “artefact” 
    o	Possibility to include other media later in project (personalized sounds/music for specific plants)
•	Vintage dinner ware (teacups, plates)
    o	Lots of options to choose from (variety of potters, locations, age, personal history)
    o	Belonged to Great-Grandmother – grandmother – mother -me
    o	Potters have significant history in the places they are from (Canada, England, India) 
    o	Possibility to fit into another personal interest project (family History archive)

1st test run for making the models:

Windsor Arms Building: Space too large / can’t fit full height of walls in Trnio app, doesn’t seem that Trnio can make 3D model from inside
room (object around camera not camera around object). Will try using regular camera and Windows app (zephyr)

Plants: Not going to pursue this idea further for the project. Might continue as personal project.

Vintage Dinner ware: experimenting with what type of background, lighting, angle works best while using Trnio app.


•	Overall Trnio has been working better for me, zephyr crashes if I have been working on it for a while and can’t handle larger objects.
•	While doing some basic introductory research on my objects, I feel that my vintage plates have the most substantial background and are the most realistic 3D object for me to recreate.
