3D Model project - process notes:
Jan 15, 2018
Brainstorm:
•	Windsor Arms Historical residential building (lobby? Front entrance? Mail room?)
    o	Personal connection to building
    o	historical significance in Ottawa
    o	Many original features still in tact
    o	Might be difficult to build a 3D model of due to size 
•	House plants
    o	Build a repository / guide to house plants using 3D models of the plants
    o	Con: no significant history, not an “artefact” 
    o	Possibility to include other media later in project (personalized sounds/music for specific plants)
•	Vintage dinner ware (teacups, plates)
    o	Lots of options to choose from (variety of potters, locations, age, personal history)
    o	Belonged to Great-Grandmother – grandmother – mother -me
    o	Potters have significant history in the places they are from (Canada, England, India) 
    o	Possibility to fit into another personal interest project (family History archive)
