Brainstorm: Virtual tour of town - walk through and be introduced to different photos, facts, stories, etc. 

Potential issues: how to make a AR on objects that no longer exists? - how to trigger image when landscape has changed (possible issue getting updated photos on area. 

1st attempt: playing around with objects and triggers, no solid plan on story line yet, what should be the trigger for the AR of the plate? so far it is difficult to make edits to order of objects and triggers once they are made. create Vuforia account - selected cloud database - uploading the download provided to ARIS does not work - better results when I created a Device database. running into error messages when uploading media and AR target images (seems to be resolved after deleting the multiple copies of downloads / images and using originals only). 

2nd attempt: decided to start new game to avoid the messiness in the game objects bar created by the failed attempts in the 1st game. 
process: created startign scene, added converstaion "welcome to Saint Josephs" - gave player choices in what information they wanted to persue - set a location trigger, added item "st josephs sign" - set AR trigger to show the plate when looking at sign - in future would like the trigger image to be photo of greatgrandmothers house but for now welcome sign will do, added web page - set location trigger - web link to wiki page about st.joseph's (attempt at using link as some sort of bibliography sourse for facts used in converstation). 


Final Notes:
- tutorials unhelpful in guiding me on how to publish or finish game. workaround?: give username and password for others to be able to see the game. unsure if they will be able to actually interact with game, possibily only be able to see how game is made...
