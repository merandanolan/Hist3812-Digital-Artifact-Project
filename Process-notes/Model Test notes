Tracking progress for Vintage Dinner Ware
Test 	Outcome
Natural light, no solid background, stand to hold plate upright (green), upward camera angle	Light slightly too low, background messy, green stand takes away from details of plate, camera angle ok but makes curvature of plate slightly distorted
Natural light, one lamp nearby, White background, covered green stand with white sheet, downward camera angle	Light good, slight shadow, background good (adjust the position of background slightly to cover full camera turn), angle similar problem to last test.
Natural Light, Lamp placed above object, white background, stand covered in white sheet, straight on camera angle 	Light good no shadow, background good, camera angle good
